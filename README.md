Mothereffin' SVG sparklines. Check out the [demo/test page](http://sparksvg.me/test.html).

Orignally by [Stuart Langridge](http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/12/30/simple-svg-sparklines), based on [Jeremy Keith's](http://adactio.com/journal/5941/) idea.

## Basic usage

### line.svg

```html
<embed src="//sparksvg.me/line.svg?0,4,7,10,8,12,9,7,3,0" type="image/svg+xml">
```

### circle.svg

The `circle.svg` redraws itself when the page is resized, so it's always looking smart. Excepting in buggy Firefox, where it can't get its height properly and tries to guess.

```html
<embed src="//sparksvg.me/circle.svg?0,4,7,10,8,12,9,7,3,0" type="image/svg+xml">
```

## Contributing

You want to contribute? Get started here...

### The code

To add a feature, open up the `.svg` in a text editor, where you'll find some javascript. Make some changes, make it better and submit your work as a pull request!

### By the way...

This is meant to be a lightweight solution, so please don't add any libraries, and make sure your change works in **all** the working browsers listed below, by adding a test case to the `test.html`.

If it's a new feature, don't edit any of the existing test cases, add a new one, and try them in combination too. The more testing, the merrier.
